                        <br><br> Stems from an old episode of Harry and Paul that can be watched here: 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9IJnmbneLc" target="_blank">Harry & Paul 40...45</a> 
                        <br><br>The basic premis is that everything tends to be 40-45, which then also extends to 4 to 5.
                        <br>Last year saw the joke 5 to 4 appear at 3:55pm Thursday, it is unclear if this will catch on or not.

                            <li>Fine wine - 5 wine glasses of ranging volumes</li>

                                <br>Each round lasts until the Jack finishes their beer, and has as many plays as required
                                <br>Each play is kicked off by the Jack taking a drinke from their beer
                                <br>The Jack places their beer on the table for all to see
                                <br>Each player then drinks from their own beer and attempts to land as close to the Jacks level as possible
                                <br>The player furthest away loses the play. They choose one of the fine wines as punishment, and then become the Jack for the next round
                                <br>While a losing player is doing their wine fine of fine wine, all other players show support of the act by chanting origingally "fine wine wine fine" and with time and extened fines, and combination of the words fine and wine to the right tune.
                                <br><br>Fine print rules:
                            </p>
                            <ol class="urlist">
                                <li>Each time a player drinks must be one smooth drink. The bottle can not come away from your mouth to inspect level mid drink. As soon as your lips leave the bottle that is the level you enter</li>
                                <li>When the Jack drink they MUST reach below the lowest level of all players. On occassion, if the Jack lost the previous round by being too high this can result in them needing to drink a considerable amount to catch up</li>
                                <li>A player may not hold your own beer next to the Jacks to compare. The only time any players beer should be held next to the Jack's is if it is not cler that the Jack has cleared the bottom drink. In this case the comparison must be made by a player who is not drinking from either of the beers in question</li>

                            <li>Fines: bad things that people have done (eg. stopped a chair lift, skiied off without someone, aggressively flirted with
                                an 18 year old chalet host, missed apres ski to hang out with their partner...)

                                a 19 year old chalet host)

                            This is followed by a brief description outlining the fine. 
                            <br><br> IMPORTANT to the integrity of the fine book, no entry has an author. Everything is anomanous
                            <br><br>
                            each evening we will read through the fine book, at each fine the culprit will have to apologise to the group
                            by saying nothing, and drnking a suitible amount of, usually, fine wine.
                            <br><br> each time a commendation is read out, the rest of the group raise their glasses to honour the good deed.
                            <br><br> Fines are distributed by the captain for the night, who is the purest form of a dictator known to a ski trip. 
                            They may have a first mate to help keep the crowds under control, and both may hand out additional fines if they wish.
                            <br><br>When a fine is read out it may not be challenged by anyone other than Captain - who may choose to over rule a 
                            fine, or indeed amend a fine to a commendation. In the case that a fine is of particular interest to the group, it may be
                            demanded of the culprit to tell the story of the fine. Again, at the complete discretion of the Captain.
